        The inner four planets closest to the sun — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are often called the "terrestrial planets" 
        because their surfaces are rocky. Pluto also has a rocky, albeit frozen, surface but has never been grouped with the 
        four terrestrials. The four large outer worlds — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — are sometimes called the 
        Jovian or "Jupiter-like" planets because of their enormous size relative to the terrestrial planets. They're also 
        mostly made of gases like hydrogen, helium and ammonia rather than of rocky surfaces, although astronomers believe 
        some or all of them may have solid cores.
